# space_game

Playground/reflection for a graphical base lib in python
Parts of the code will be splitted into differents libs later

## Future libs divison

- Mathematics (Vertices, Matrices, operations)
- Game logic abstraction (Context, Window, Inputs, Map, Update ...)
- Graphical abstraction (same lib as game logic ?)
- Graphical implementation using tkinter

## Features implemented

- Main game logic (tkinter)
- Map and Entity update
- Vertex2f (2dim) and basic operations
- Input (mouse)
- Basic graphical abstraction

## FactorIO like game :

Focused on factory management/optimisation with money, energy, production default systems

- Belt and Material transportation - OK
- Factory processing + input/output - OK
- Material configuration and Crafting recipes - WIP
- Money system - WIP
- Menu abstraction + Editor - Next

## Others game relative subjects:

- room detection (see the_space/space_map.py::\_update_rooms)
